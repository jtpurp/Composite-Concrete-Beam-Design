# Prestressed-Concrete-Beam-Design
Example problem statement and design methodology shown below, relative to the Composite Concrete Beam Design Project Example pdf file. The Composite Concrete Beam Design Mathcad file can be altered with different design parameters to represent another composite concrete beam and loading scenario if desired.

Problem Statement

Given a 100 ft. simple span composite decked bulb T beam with 12-straight 1/2in. 
diameter 270 ksi low relaxation steel pretensioning strands and a draped post-tensioned tendon 
(see Figure 1). Determine the service stresses in the beam, size of the post-tensioning tendon 
needed to carry the service loads, and final service level stresses from full sequence of loads. 
Also, check the nominal capacity of the beam and design shear reinforcement. Make sure to 
adhere to ACI Building Code requirements.

Design Methodology

Geometry, section, and material properties as well as loading of the beam were 
determined (see pages 5-7). The stresses in the concrete due to the pretensioned strands in Load
Stage 1 were determined and checked with the ACI Building code requirements and assuming 
allowable stresses of ±0.8f’ci at the ends of the member (see page 11). The final service stresses 
in the concrete were then calculated considering the full sequence of loads (see pages 12-14) and 
the post-tensioned tendon was sized with 4, 0.5 diameter strands to ensure the member satisfied 
the minimum stresses to classify it as Class U according to ACI 24.5.2.1. Next, the flexural 
strength of the section was calculated and it was determined that the moment capacity was not 
sufficient to support the factored moment. The post-tensioned tendon was then resized to 13, 0.5 
diameter strands in order to ensure moment capacity was sufficient (see page 20). After 
recalculating the final service stresses, the member was still classified as Class U (see page 11). 
Finally, the shear strength of the member was determined and compared with the factored shear 
(see pages 21-23). Shear reinforcement was sized with #3 stirrups and spaced to ensure the 
member’s shear capacity was sufficient and that minimum reinforcement and spacing 
requirements of ACI were met (see pages 24-28). Section and elevation drawings of the final 
member are shown on page 3. Factored shear and moment as well as final shear and moment 
capacity diagrams are shown on page 4.
